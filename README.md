# Advanced QBCore Wheelchair Script 🦽

This script lets players spawn a wheelchair vehicle using an item called wheelchair within the QBCore framework. Both the wheelchair item and vehicle spawn code can be customized in the `config.lua`. Players can also remove the wheelchair and return it to their inventory. Adjust the target system by modifying the `config.lua` file.

## Features 🌟

- Spawn a wheelchair vehicle (`iak_wheelchair`) using the `wheelchair` item. 🚀
- Remove the wheelchair using `qb-target` or `ox_target` (configurable in `config.lua`). ❌

## Installation ⚙️

1. **Download and Extract** 📥
   - Download the script, remove the main from the end, and extract it to your `resources` folder.

2. **Add to Server Config** 📝
   - Add the resource to your `server.cfg`:
     ```plaintext
     ensure qb-wheelchair
     ```

3. **Configure Item** ⚙️
   - Add the `wheelchair` item to your `qb-core/shared/items.lua` file:
     ```lua
     ['wheelchair'] = {['name'] = 'wheelchair', ['label'] = 'Wheelchair', ['weight'] = 5000, ['type'] = 'item', ['image'] = 'wheelchair.png', ['unique'] = false, ['useable'] = true, ['shouldClose'] = true, ['combinable'] = nil, ['description'] = 'A portable wheelchair to help you move around.'},
     ```

4. **Add Item Image** 🖼️
   - Place the `wheelchair.png` image in the `qb-inventory/html/images` directory.

## Usage 🎮
